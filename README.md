# Configs_and_Scripts

This repo groups all the script I have created and used so far!

More and more scripts will be hosted in this repository!

## Requirements

* neofetch
* bbswitch if you use turn\_off\_nvidia
* [oh-my-zsh installed](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) or [oh-my-bash](https://github.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash)

I mostly use debian-based distributions so my aliases uses apt to update my system.


### reset\_nvidia\_pci

This script requires you to run Ubuntu distribution and should be used when you wish to switch back to your Nvidia GPU and it should use before `sudo prime-select nvidia`.

A python script will soon be distributed on pypi and will automate the process.
